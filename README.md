# DeepMass

DeepMass is a suite of tools in development at Verily to enable mass
spectrometry data analysis using modern machine learning techniques.

## Prism

The first tool to be included in DeepMass is Prism, a computational framework to
predict MS2 fragmentation peak intensities. Developed in collaboration with the
Max Planck Institute, Prism's accuracy approaches the theoretical limit imposed
by experimental uncertainty.

We provide Prism as a service using [Google Cloud Machine Learning
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine). This repository contains
instructions and utilities to get started.

## Updates

We plan on expanding & updating DeepMass into a comprehensive suite of tools for
a broad array of Mass Spec capabilities. For information, updates, or to
contribute, please reach out to us at DeepMass@google.com.
